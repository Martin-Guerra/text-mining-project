But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.  They always need to have things explained.  My Drawing Number Two looked like this:\n",

      "The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.  That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.  I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.  Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes.  I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me.  At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.  If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence.  I have lived a great deal among grown-ups.  I have seen them intimately, close at hand.  And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept.  I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding.  But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:\n",

And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.  It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.\n",

      "\n",
      "The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation.  I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.  Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.  It said:\n",

And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.  Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him.  But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment.  Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.  And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.  Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.  When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But--what are you doing here?\"\n",

      "\"If you please--draw me a sheep . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey.  Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.  But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw.  He answered me:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That doesn't matter.  Draw me a sheep . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had never drawn a sheep.  So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.  It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.  And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no, no!  I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.  A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome.  Where I live, everything is very small.  What I need is a sheep.  Draw me a sheep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No.  This sheep is already very sickly.  Make me another.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What is that object?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What! You dropped down from the sky?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away . . .\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Tie him! What a queer idea!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, \"Asteroid 325.\"\n",

When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, \"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?\" Instead, they demand: \"How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?\" Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\n",

I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.\n",

      "Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a question of discipline,\" the little prince said to me later on. \"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,\" the little prince added, \"but very easy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And one day he said to me: \"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,\" he added, \"there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. \"Children,\" I say plainly, \"watch out for the baobabs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.\n",

But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet.

But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes!

He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, \"One never knows!\" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions.

It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why is that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\"I know some one,\" said the little prince, \"who would make a bad explorer.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"One goes to see it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Geographies,\" said the geographer, \"are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,\" the little prince interrupted. \"What does that mean-- 'ephemeral'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,\" said the geographer. \"The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what does that mean--'ephemeral'?\" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe; then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.\n",

And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.\n",

You have, I know, confidence in me.\n",

      "After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees.

      "\"My life is very monotonous,\" the fox said. \"I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . .\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One only understands the things that one tames,\" said the fox. \"Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What must I do, to tame you?\" asked the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must be very patient,\" replied the fox. \"First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day the little prince came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\" said the fox. \"If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you . . . One must observe the proper rites . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is a rite?\" asked the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those also are actions too often neglected,\" said the fox. \"They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Ah,\" said the fox, \"I shall cry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is your own fault,\" said the little prince. \"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that is so,\" said the fox.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"But now you are going to cry!\" said the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that is so,\" said the fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it has done you no good at all!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has done me good,\" said the fox, \"because of the color of the wheat fields.\" And then he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not at all like my rose,\" he said. \"As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the roses were very much embarassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are beautiful, but you are empty,\" he went on. \"One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he went back to meet the fox.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodbye,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodbye,\" said the fox. \"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is essential is invisible to the eye,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--\" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Men have forgotten this truth,\" said the fox. \"But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am responsible for my rose,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning,\" said the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning,\" said the railway switchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you do here?\" the little prince asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand,\" said the switchman. \"I send off the trains that carry them: now to the right, now to the left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are in a great hurry,\" said the little prince. \"What are they looking for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,\" said the switchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they coming back already?\" demanded the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are not the same ones,\" said the switchman. \"It is an exchange.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Were they not satisfied where they were?\" asked the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one is ever satisfied where he is,\" said the switchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they pursuing the first travelers?\" demanded the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are pursuing nothing at all,\" said the switchman. \"They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only the children know what they are looking for,\" said the little prince. \"They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are lucky,\" the switchman said.\n",

      "\"Good morning,\" said the little prince.\n",

      "\"Good morning,\" said the merchant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why are you selling those?\" asked the little prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because they save a tremendous amount of time,\" said the merchant. \"Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?\"\n",

      "\"Anything you like . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As for me,\" said the little prince to himself, \"if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah,\" I said to the little prince, \"these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend the fox--\" the little prince said to me.\n",

      "\"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I am about to die of thirst . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has no way of guessing the danger,\" I said to myself. \"He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you are thirsty, too?\" I demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Water may also be good for the heart . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied, \"Yes, that is so.\" And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The desert is beautiful,\" the little prince added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes the desert beautiful,\" said the little prince, \"is that somewhere it hides a well . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I said to the little prince. \"The house, the stars, the desert--what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad,\" he said, \"that you agree with my fox.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: \"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible . . .\"\n",
