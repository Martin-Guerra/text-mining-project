<p align=justify>
It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.

<p align=justify>
"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"

<p align=justify>
"My friend the fox--" the little prince said to me.

<p align=justify>
"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!"

<p align=justify>
"Why not?"

<p align=justify>
"Because I am about to die of thirst . . ."

<p align=justify>
He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:

<p align=justify>
"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend . . ."

<p align=justify>
"He has no way of guessing the danger," I said to myself. "He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs . . ."

<p align=justify>
But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:

<p align=justify>
"I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well . . ."

<p align=justify>
I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking. 

<p align=justify>
When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:

<p align=justify>
"Then you are thirsty, too?" I demanded.

<p align=justify>
But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:

<p align=justify>
"Water may also be good for the heart . . ."

<p align=justify>
I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.

<p align=justify>
He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:

<p align=justify>
"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."

<p align=justify>
I replied, "Yes, that is so." And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.

<p align=justify>
"The desert is beautiful," the little prince added.

<p align=justify>
And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams . . .

<p align=justify>
"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well . . ."

<p align=justify>
I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart . . .

<p align=justify>
"Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert--what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!"

<p align=justify>
"I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."

<p align=justify>
As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible . . ."

<p align=justify>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .

<p align=justify>
And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.
